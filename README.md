## Description

This project represents the backend of an e commerce site selling categorized products.
Project begins with starter code from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella. The object is to take the working Express.js API and coinfigure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL db.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Motivation

Project motivation came from the desire to complete a MySQL / Node / Express / API project based on what I have learned in bootcamp so far and to satisfy course requirements for Module 13.

## Learn

I learned how to apply routes to handle requests and actions within Insomnia to interact with MySQL, to write routes and controllers for JSON requests.

## Usage

This API collection may be used by anyone learning to code with MySQL, JavaScript, Node, Express and APIs.
